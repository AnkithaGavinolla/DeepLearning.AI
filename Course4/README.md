Course4:Convolution Neural Networks
  * Week1:
    * W1A1: CNN network step by step forward propagation  implementation with numpy library.
    * W1A2: Developed a CNN network with Keras Sequential API to determine whether people in the images are smiling or not. Network is trained on the Happy House dataset and achieved an accuracy of 94%.
    * W1A3: Developed a CNN network with Keras Functional API to recognize digits from sign language images. Network is trained on SIGNS dataset and achieved an accuracy of 80%. 
  * Week2:
    * W2A1: Built and trained ResNet50 Network Model to recognize digits from sign language images. Network is trained on SIGNS dataset and achieved an accuracy of 96%. 
    * W2A2: Built an Alpaca/Non Alpaca classifier by transfer learning from a MobileNetV2 network trained on ImageNet.
  * Week3:
    * W3A1: Built a Driving Application Object Detection System to detect 80 classes with 5 anchor boxes from a pre-trained YOLOV2 network output and applying filtering and NMS.
    * W3A2: Developed a own U-Net architecture to implement semantic image segmentation for pixel wise class predictions for images. The Network is trained on CARLA self driving car dataset. 
  * Week4:
    * W4A1: Build a face verification and face recognition application on trained FaceNet model
    * W4A2: Generate new Art with NeuralStyle transfer from a content image and styling image built with VGG-19 Network.
